# code_collab
This project was submitted for the first semester of my 2nd year of Master's at Dauphine - PSL. It was a binary classification problem where we had to predict the socio-economic category of approximately 50,000 people in France using various metrics of their economic strata provided to us.

It was done by my classmate and I together and the original code is stored at https://github.com/RayNCode/code_collab. 

We coded in Python using Google Colab and Kaggle.
